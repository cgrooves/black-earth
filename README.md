# Black Earth
A _Scorched Earth_ clone, made for fun.

## Overview

Our goal is to create a clone of the popular MS-DOS game _Scorched Earth_, using the [Python Arcade Library](https://arcade.academy/index.html).
## Contribute

We will try to follow a feature-branch development pattern.

- Identify a feature to work on or bug to fix (preferrably create or use a Github Issue)
- Create a branch
- Complete your work in your branch
- Create a pull request to merge your branch into _main_

### Environment

Since we are developing a Python application here, we recommend using a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). Since Python Arcade requires Python 3.6 or higher, we recommend creating the virtual environment using a python3 command:

```
shell_prompt$: python3 -m venv <venv_name>
```

Once you have created and activated your virtual environment, synchronize your packages with the listed `requirements.txt` file in the repository.


```
(venv_name) shell_prompt$: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When new packages need to be installed, please update the `requirements.txt` file by running:

```
(venv_name) shell_prompt$: pip freeze -l > requirements.txt
```

This will ensure that other developers will be using the same Python packages and versions as you, and that we all stay in sync.
